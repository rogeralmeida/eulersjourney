# Euler's Journey

The Euler's Journey is a attempt to implement the [Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net) problems in many programming languages.
My objectives are:
* Compare how differents programming languages resolve commons problems
* Have a place to point when comparing languages
* Improve my programming skills in many languages

## Programming Languages
The programming languages are:
* Java 1.8
* Scala
* Python 2
* Ruby
* Javascript

# Analysis
My personal opinion about the code will be shared in my personal blog (http://roger-almeida.blogspot.com.br/)[http://roger-almeida.blogspot.com.br]
